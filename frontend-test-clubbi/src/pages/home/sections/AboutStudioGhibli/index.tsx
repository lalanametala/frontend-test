          Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata,
          Toshio Suzuki and Yasuyoshi Tokuma, shortly after the success of
          Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind the previous year.
          The studio released its first film, Castle in the Sky, the following year.
          The company`s logo is Totoro, the character from the movie
          My Neighbor Totoro, released in 1988.
          With the exception of six productions,
          all of the studio`s films were directed by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata.
          Toshio Suzuki, meanwhile, is the producer for most of them.
          In 2001, the Ghibli Museum, a museum dedicated to the studio`s works, opened.
